      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Bannada Daara is a home-grown initiative started in 2020, creating
        hand-stitched products using upcycled textile excesses. We believe in
        sustainability, craftsmanship, and giving new life to materials that
        would otherwise go to waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each product is carefully crafted with love and attention to detail,
        making every piece unique and special. Join us in our mission to create
        a more sustainable future, one stitch at a time.
